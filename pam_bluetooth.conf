# Bluetooth PAM Module Configuration

# Device MAC address (required)
# Find your device MAC with: bluetoothctl -> devices
device = XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# Minimum signal strength in dBm (optional, default: -80)
# Typical ranges:
#   -30 to -50: Very close (same room)
#   -50 to -70: Close (nearby rooms)
#   -70 to -90: Far (different floor)
# Higher (less negative) = stronger signal required
# Note: strength will be converted to negative dBm internally
# So strength = 150 becomes -150 dBm minimum requirement
# Positive values are flipped negative; 0 or invalid = error
strength = -10

# Request fresh RSSI reading (optional, default: 0)
# 0 = Use cached RSSI value (faster, ~0ms delay)
# 1 = Force fresh RSSI reading (more accurate, ~50-100ms delay)
# Fresh readings provide current signal strength but add latency
# Use 1 for stricter proximity authentication, 0 for speed
request_update = 0

# Check device trust status (optional, default: 1)
# 0 = Skip trust verification (allow any paired device)
# 1 = Require device to be marked as trusted in BlueZ
# Trusted devices are those explicitly marked trusted via:
#   bluetoothctl -> trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
# This adds an extra security layer beyond just being paired
# Recommended: 1 for security, 0 for convenience
# Note: Trust checking requires root privileges to read BlueZ config files
